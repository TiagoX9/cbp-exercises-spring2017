	<p  class="red" id="biography"> <span>With an authoritative voice </span>and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected
		figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher,
		and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years
		in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing
		in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!. <p class="green">Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several
		characters including "Easy Reader ", "Mel Mounds " and "Count Dracula " on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame
		Workshop) show <span class="seen">The Electric Company (1971)</span>. He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, <span class="unseen">Who Says

		X in <span class="seen">Death of a Prophet (1981)</span>. For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films
		that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/ " target="_blank
